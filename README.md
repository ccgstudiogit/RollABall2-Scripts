# Development Reflection
Roll-A-Ball was my attempt to take the original Roll-A-Ball concept and develop it into a more structured, content-driven experience. Instead of
relying on a single play area with a single randomized path, this sequel has 12 handcrafted levels, each with its own layout, difficulty, and
moving obstacle patterns.

One of the biggest upgrades from Roll-A-Ball is that in Roll-A-Ball 2, the player can actually use the mouse to look around with the camera. While
the original used a static overhead camera and simple movements, Roll-A-Ball 2 required a more advanced setup that combined a free-look camera with
tighter player controls, which were needed in order for the player to navigate through the dynamic levels. This was also the first project where I
created some of my own assets, which gave me a chance to understand the full process of 3D model creation, texturing, and importing.

In regards to programming, I took what I learned from Crazy Runner and implemented a file-save system that tracked which levels the player had
completed or unlocked. This gavethe game a sense of progression and introduced the need to manage persistent data, level states, and UI updates tied
to the player's progress. I think completing this game is what caused me to cross the bridge from not being able to make something publishable, to
having the confidence to make a full game and put it out there, which is what led me to create my first published project, They Watch.
