# RollABall2-Scripts
The scripts for my mini game sequel to Roll-A-Ball, Roll-A-Ball 2. These scripts are available for portfolio and educational purposes.

# Development Timeline
August 2024 - October 2024

# About the Project
Roll-A-Ball was my attempt to take the original Roll-A-Ball concept and develop it into a more structured, content-driven experience. Instead of
relying on a single play area with a static randomized path, this sequel has 12 manually-created levels, each with its own layout, difficulty, and
moving obstacle patterns.

Upon starting the game, the player only has the first level unlocked and they may unlock levels by completing the previous level. Each level also
increases in difficulty, with new obstacles being introduced throughout the game as the player progresses. Also, there are 3 main themes: levels
1-4 have a cloud theme, levels 5-8 have a fire theme, and levels 9-12 have a void theme.

# Development Reflection
One of the biggest upgrades from Roll-A-Ball is that in Roll-A-Ball 2, the player can actually use the mouse to look around with the camera. While
the original used a static overhead camera and simple movements, Roll-A-Ball 2 required a more advanced setup that combined a free-look camera with
tighter player controls, which were needed in order for the player to navigate through the moving levels. This was also the first project where I
created some of my own assets, which gave me a chance to understand the full process of 3D model creation, texturing, and importing.

In regards to programming, I took what I learned from Crazy Runner and tried to make the game's systems and scripts more modular and less dependent
on each other. This is because I noticed while developing Crazy Runner there were a lot of dependencies that made testing a lot more difficult, as
an example I would have to start the game from the main menu every time I wanted to test something in the game scene, which made testing the game
a lot more time consuming.
